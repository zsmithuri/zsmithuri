    <h1>Some things that I enjoy doing</h1>
        <p>I enjoy playing airsoft(similar to painball) and building computers I have been doing both for about five years. 
            The first picture is me and my friends getting ready to play airsoft. The second picture is my computer that I built a few years ago. 
            Ive been drawing since I was in elementry school and persued it as a hobby ever since. I also enjoy gaming online, my favorite game is Apex Legends.
            My favorite time of year is winter because I enjoy the snow.</p>
